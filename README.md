## Slow loris -> slow_loris.py 

A slow loris attack is a type of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that uses multiple computers to send a large number of requests to a web server or other online service in order to overwhelm it with traffic and cause it to crash.

For example, a hacker might use a network of infected computers to send a continuous stream of HTTP requests to a web server. This flood of requests would eventually cause the server to become overloaded and crash, preventing legitimate users from accessing the website.
